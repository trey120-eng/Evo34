### Hello
my name is Trey and this is the Evo34 keyboard the orginal name was project altea. its using the nice nano v2 and zmk
I started designing it about 6 months ago and I have been improving it since i started with making the layout
then i made the first pcb which was meant to use the seeed studio xiao nrf52480 but i had some problems so i 
moved on to the NiceNano V2 which made it possible to add a reset button and power (there probably was a to add them but i didnt know how)
then the case which I made many designs but only printed 2 of them and i use klp lame keycaps
I used jlc3dp and jlcpcb to make everything 

> [!WARNING]
> This keyboard has muiltiple problems.
I will try to improve it but actively there are flaws with my design such as:

- The case needs a lot of improvement and adjustments
* pcb needs improvments but fully working
