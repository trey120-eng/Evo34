* This is the Evo34 its designed using ergogen and kicad.

i designed it for a 8th grade project and i decided to open source it
The evo34 uses zmk frimware with zmk studio support 
also there is a unibody version which [here](https://shield-wizard.genteure.workers.dev/)

it uses a NiceNanoV2 (i used a clone for cost saving)
klplame keycaps made by braindefender
and the reset button, power switch, and battery are from typeractive 



> [!WARNING]
> This keyboard has muiltiple problems.
I will try to improve it but actively there are flaws with my design such as:


* The case needs a lot of improvement and adjustments
* pcb needs improvments but fully working
* and this is a repo just for the files and parts no asemably guide at this monment
